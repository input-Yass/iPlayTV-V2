            devices (internet connection required) (each a “compatible device”). In addition, even if other aspects of the Services

            be limited by law or by the rights that certain of our third-party content providers grant to us. The periods during

            your subscription. Access to the Services from locations where we do not have rights, that are not offered on your

            will be determined by your Home, even if you access the Services from outside your Home. Moreover, your access to live
            Content from local affiliates, if any, will depend on the location of your device at the time you access the Services.

            which you are accessing the applicable Service Tier or third-party services, and we may use different technologies and
            methods to verify your location. You may be required to enable location access on your device in order to access certain
